```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

mal <- read.csv("./MozSyntheticMalaria.csv")

# creating cases per thousand variable
mal$denom <- mal$Population_UN*mal$u5weight
mal$cpt <- (mal$malaria/mal$denom)*1000

head(mal)

```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
